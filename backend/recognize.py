recognize.py - CCTV classroom attendance: given a video clip (or live stream), detect faces,
track them across frames, and recognize each track (AdaFace ir101) only as often as needed.

Setup:    pip install insightface onnxruntime opencv-python numpy gdown

Usage:
    python recognize.py --video clip.mp4
    python recognize.py --video clip.mp4 --students-json roster.json --json-out result.json --class-id 12

Folders (all next to this script, override with the matching flag):
    models/    det_10g.onnx (SCRFD detector) and adaface_ir101.onnx (recognizer) - downloaded
               automatically on first run from MODEL_URLS below
    gallery/   one sub-folder per student, e.g. gallery/yash/front.jpg, gallery/yash/left.jpg
    cache/     saved gallery embeddings per class, so they are not recomputed on every run

How a track gets marked present
--------------------------------
Detection runs every sampled frame (cheap); recognition (AdaFace) is the expensive step and is
only run on a track that is not yet resolved, up to --max-attempts times, and only on frames that
pass two free pre-checks first (big enough, not blurry). AdaFace's own feature norm (a free
by-product of every recognition call - see https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00964) is used as a second,
post-hoc quality check: a low-norm result still counts against --max-attempts (the compute was
spent) but is not trusted as a match. A track keeps trying on later frames until it matches, or
runs out of attempts and is left unresolved for the rest of the clip.

--max-attempts bounds the cost of ONE face, not the length of the scan: a classroom almost always
has absentees, so waiting for "everyone present" to stop is not a real exit condition. --duration
is the actual scan budget - it caps how much video (in seconds of video time) gets processed,
independent of how many students have been found. Without it, a recorded file is still bounded by
its own length; a live/RTSP source is NOT (frame count is unreliable or unavailable on a stream),
so --duration should always be set for live use.

Attendance is kept by STUDENT IDENTITY, not by track ID: if a track is lost and the same student
is re-detected later as a new track, they simply get recognized again under their existing
record - nothing needs to link the two track IDs together. This is also why the tracker in
tracker.py is deliberately simple (see that file's docstring): track continuity here is a
compute-saving device, not something correctness depends on.

Gallery is scoped to the class: with --students-json (and ideally --class-id), only the gallery
folders belonging to that roster are embedded and searched. This matters for correctness, not
just speed - matching against the whole school's gallery means an unrelated student's face can
win the nearest-match search over the correct (but slightly lower-scoring) class student, silently
losing a real match.

Node.js integration
--------------------
--students-json points at a roster file the backend writes: a JSON list of
{"student_id", "gallery_folder", "name"}. Each student is matched to gallery/<gallery_folder>/.
--class-id keys the embeddings cache so different classes never share (or fight over) one cache
file. --json-out is where the result is written: {"present_students": [...], "absent_students":
[...], "annotated_image": "<path, if --annotated-out was used>"}.
